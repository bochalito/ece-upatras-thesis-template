# ECE UPatras Thesis Template in LaTeX

## General
This is a template in LaTeX for the diploma thesis of the department of Electrical and Computer engineering of the University of Patras. Since the university does not provide an official LaTeX template I thought that sharing my work could help anyone who is writing a diploma thesis for the above department.

## Prerequisites
In order to use the template you have to install a version of LaTeX locally. You can also use any online LaTeX editor/compiler, e.g. [Sharelatex](http://sharelatex.com) and [Overleaf](http;//overleaf.com).

## Compile
In order for the template to work, you have to compile it with `xelatex`. Usually 2 compiles are needed to update contents, links and references. You can create a custom build command that calls `xelatex` twice.
